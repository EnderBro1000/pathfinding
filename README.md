# pathfinding

This is a project to solve problem 16 from Lockheed Martin's [2014 CodeQuest competition](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/who-we-are/communities/codequest/code-quest-past-quests/codeQuest-2014.html).

The problem gives you a map of a cave. There is a starting point, torches, and a goal. The code must navigate through the cave from the start to the goal and find the most optimal path. You can only take 15 steps per torch, so you may need to collect some on the way.
